# sm64-visiblePUs-coop
A fork of sm64ex-coop, trying to make PUs visible.
Currently has a lot of glitches, but I will try to fix them.
Update: Not much glitches left anymore!
Version: beta 11 (sm64ex-coop version: beta 35)
Latest dev version: beta 11 (sm64ex-coop version: beta 35)

Hold L, Z and press A to toggle the PU display.
Current problems: Certain objects are only visible in PUs when walked far away from that they turn intangible.

## Goal
Make parallel universes visible, with absolutely no glitches.

## Contribution
