# sm64-visiblePUs-coop
A fork of sm64ex-coop, trying to make PUs visible.
Currently has a lot of glitches, but I will try to fix them.
Version: beta 6 (sm64ex-coop version: beta 35)
Latest dev version: beta 6

Hold L, Z and press A to toggle the PU display.
Current problems: Objects render in PU 0 (you won't be able to see yourself nor objects if you're in a PU, but you will be able to hear yourself and objects)

## Goal
Make parallel universes visible, with absolutely no glitches.

## Contribution
If you want to help me remove the glitches, DM me on discord. My username is defacube.
Or you can simply make a pull request.
