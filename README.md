# sm64-visiblePUs-coop
A fork of sm64ex-coop, trying to make PUs visible.
Currently has a lot of glitches, but I will try to fix them.
Update: Not much glitches left anymore!
Version: stable 12.1 (sm64ex-coop version: beta 35)
Latest dev version: stable 12.1 (sm64ex-coop version: beta 35)

Hold L, Z and press A to toggle the PU display.
Current problems: Players from PU 0 can be heard, and sometimes your sounds in PUs randomly disappear.

## Goal
Make parallel universes visible, with absolutely no glitches.

## Contribution
If you want to help me remove the glitches, DM me on discord. My username is defacube.
Or you can simply make a pull request.
